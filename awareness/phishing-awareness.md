# Security Awareness: Phishing Defense Guide

## What is Phishing?
Phishing is a deceptive technique used by attackers to trick you into revealing sensitive information, such as your login credentials or financial details. These attacks typically arrive via email, text message (Smishing), or phone calls (Vishing).

## Common Red Flags
Be on the lookout for these signs of a phishing attempt:
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message claims your account will be deleted or a payment failed, demanding immediate action.
* **Suspicious Sender Address:** The email looks official but comes from a domain like `security-gcp-verify.com` instead of our official `@company.com`.
* **Generic Greetings:** Messages that start with "Dear Valued Customer" instead of your actual name.
* **Unexpected Attachments:** Emails asking you to download an "invoice" or "internal report" that you weren't expecting.

## What Should You Do?
1.  **Do Not Click:** Never click on links or download attachments from an unverified or suspicious source.
2.  **Verify the Source:** If you receive a request for sensitive data, contact the person through a known-good channel (like Slack or a direct phone call) to confirm they sent it.
3.  **Check the URL:** Before entering your password, always double-check the browser address bar to ensure you are on the legitimate site.

## How to Report an Incident
If you think you have accidentally clicked a suspicious link or provided your credentials to a fake site:
* **Immediately Change Your Password:** Reset your account password from a known-safe device.
* **Notify Security:** Open a ticket or email the security team at `security-alerts@company.com`.
* **Don't Be Embarrassed:** Quick reporting is the best way to prevent a minor mistake from becoming a major data breach.
