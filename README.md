# FitTrack Pro Security Portfolio

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end security program for FitTrack Pro, a fictional SaaS fitness tracking application. It showcases my skills in cybersecurity governance, risk, and compliance (GRC), drawing from my experience in incident response, fraud detection, PCI-DSS enforcement, and secure app development.

## Fictional Company Overview
FitTrack Pro is a web-based SaaS platform that allows users to track workouts, create programs, and subscribe to premium features. It serves individual users, with a focus on user privacy and secure payments.

- **Technologies Used**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for hosting, Firebase/Firestore for authentication and database, Stripe for payments, web app built with modern frameworks (e.g., React for frontend, Node.js for API).
